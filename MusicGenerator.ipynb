Moreover, CNNs are supervised learning models, and our dataset does not include genre labels. For this reason, we found another dataset containing 100 songs in .wav format for each of the following musical genres:\n",

    "- rock\n",

    "The idea is to train the CNN using this labeled dataset. Before doing that, we need to perform some preprocessing, since some songs in the dataset are corrupted. Additionally, the audio clips are only a few seconds long, so we preprocess each song to have a fixed length and a consistent format. The preprocessing functions are implemented in the file **CNN_ExtractGenre.py**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing, we define the CNN model and the data loader in **Model.py** and **DataLoader.py**, respectively. The model is trained on Google Colab (not on the local machine), and we later load the trained model using its state_dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN achieves a strong validation accuracy of 84%, as shown in the accompanying paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is trained on the labeled dataset, we use it to classify our own songs. This is a complex process because our songs are in .mid format, while the model expects .wav spectrograms as input. Therefore, each MIDI file must be converted into audio, transformed into a spectrogram, and then classified by the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
